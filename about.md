# About...
My name is In√©s Karami and i study DataAnalysis at IHM, but have a background in psychology. 
Before going back to studying Dataanalystics i helped companies devolope leaderships perspektives, recruiting  CEO and HR recruiting processes. 
I am project driven and like to learn new skills and generate new ideas. And those factors combined contributed to helping me create some fun and giving projects.
such as imployer branding campaigns and projects. A key factor for me in succeeding is being abel to feel passionated about a project, but also include colleagues and if needed work on my own.
In the future i whant to find a workspace in a company that shares the same valeus and help them reache their goals. 

thank you for taking time reading  my resume, i hope you find some of it interesting. Hope to hear from you our read your comments
